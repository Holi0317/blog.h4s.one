I have been wandering around the web and collected a lot of links, projects and
interesting ideas.

For years, most of the links goes into [Pocket] and I could search later. On a
good day I might be able to search for the thing with their title. But most of
the time my links sinks into the abyss and gone forever. Not to mention those
long-lasting tabs on my phone that never got into the system for searching.

[pocket]: https://getpocket.com/

So instead of that, I am going to make this public page for listing all of the
interesting projects and links that might be useful to anyone.
